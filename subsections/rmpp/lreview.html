						<h1>Systematic Literature Review: Implementations of e-Learning</h1>
                    </header>
					<h2><u>Review Guidelines</u></h2>
					<p>
						This review was split into three main phases: planning the review, conducting the review, and reporting the review.
						Kitchenham's research 
						into systematic literature reviews provided insight on how to perform each stage. An example of a systematic literature review conducted
						by her is is found in this paper:
						<span style="color: aliceblue">
							<a href="https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.2578" target="_blank">
								A systematic review of systematic review process research in software engineering (Kitchenham & Brereton, 2013).
							</a>
						</span>
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							There are some methodical differences intentionally made in my review to take advantage of the context of my review, but I ensured
							any differences still satisfied Kitchenham's guidelines. The reporting of this review also followed

					<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Rationale</u></h3>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Objectives</u></h3>
					<h2><u>Methods</u></h2>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Eligibility Criteria</u></h3>
					<p>
						Literature needed to meet the following criteria to be eligibile for inclusion in this literature review:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<b>Content</b>
						<li>
							Literature was required to be about educational technology.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<b>Structure</b>
						<li>
							Literature was required to be written in English.
						</li>
						<li>
							Literature was required to be either a journal article or  conference proceeding.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<b>Detail</b>
						<li>
							Literature was required to include research questions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Literature was required to state types of data that were collected.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<b>Criticality</b>
						<li>
							Literature was required to be peer-reviewed.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Information Sources</u></h3>
					<p>
						The literature search was confined to a set journals that arguably constituted the highest quality journals dedicated to
						'educational technology' that were accessible. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The first source of peer-reviewed journals was taken from the paper
						<span style="color: aliceblue">
							<a href="https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.2578" target="_blank">
								<b>Open Access Journals in Educational Technology: Results of a Survey of Experienced Users (Perkins & Lowenthal., 2016)</b>
							</a>
						</span>
						. The paper provides a list of top 25 journals that was gathered from a survey completed by 236 scholars, who had all published in open-access journals related
						to educational technology; and some consideration of journal performance metrics. The credibility of the scholars participating in the journal review, along with the
						credibility of
						<span style="color: aliceblue">
							<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6gt1zrEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank">
								Lowenthal, who has a h-index of 40,
							</a>
						</span>
						provide plausability to the journals being academically credible, so 
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							I've opted to use Perkins & Lowenthal's list of top 25 journals to help filter the literature search.
						</span> It's worth noting that
						no other journal recommendation papers were found as alternatives to Perkins & Lowenthal's list. 
						<span style="color:lightgreen">
							I believe the continued academic journal review process is beneficial for the
						systematic development of future literature reviews.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						The second source of peer-reviewed journals was a set based upon bibliometric data, specifically
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							I opted to include journals that have high h5-indexes,
						</span>
						 indicating that
						in the last 5 years, they have published high impact articles.  
						<span style="color: aliceblue">
							<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_educationaltechnology" target="_blank">
								<b>A list of 20 journals with high h5-indexes is provided by Google Scholar.</b>
							</a>
						</span>
						The h5-index metric was selected as it specifically relates to recent article popularity, and Google Scholar was selected due
						to the high amount of journals it indexes and it's accessibility. World of Science would have been selected too if it was 
						free to use.
					</p>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Search Strategy</u></h3>
					<p>
						The first phase of the search involved searching only the most recent issue of each journal. The papers were initially
						scanned to see if they met all of the eligibility criteria and if so, the paper was shortlisted for the selection process. Progress was
						tracked using a kanban board. An example of the kanban board is shown below

						margin-right: auto;
						border-width: 5px;
						border-style: solid;
						padding: 20px;
						max-width: 90vw;
					" />
					<br>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Selection Process</u></h3>
					<p>
						The selection process made use of automation tools available in the software Notion. Papers were automatically selected if they met any of the following
						criteria: 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The paper included an implementation diagram, and had technology as an object of study. 
						</li>
						<li>
							The paper included an educational assignment as a participant task, and had technology as an object of study.
						</li>
						<li>
							The paper included classification or axial coding as a data synthesis method, with context categories including education and technology. 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						An example of the results of the selection process is shown below.

					" />
					<br>
					<h3 style="color: goldenrod"><u>Data Collection Process</u></h3>
					<p>
						The review was conducted by one person manually extracting data from selected articles and storing it on the information management system
						<a href="https://www.notion.so/product" target="_blank">
							Notion
						</a> 
						. A link to the collected data can be found
