						<h1>BCS and ACM Ethical Guidelines</h1>
                    </header>
					<p>
						This is a discussion I had with peers about BCS's and ACM's guidelines.
					</p>
					<h2><u>My Intial Post</u></h2>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						In this post I'll be talking about ACM's case study titled "Automated Active Response Weaponry', which can be found
						<span style="color:blanchedalmond">
							<a href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-automated-active-response-weaponry/" target="_blank">
								here.
							</a>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						The case study describes a fictional scenario where a defence contractor develops an autonomous vehicle which has an 
						automated response system that triggers when being attacked; responding with lethal actions. ACM then identify 
						different ways that the defence contractor break the ACM Code of Ethics. The defence contractor was found to 
						have violated a bunch of principles - but I found the way the analysis was presented a bit disorganised.
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						Below I've tried to organise the analysis and summarise the information:
					</p>
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/rmpp/discussions/eguidelines/ACM1-2.png" alt="applied acm guidelines" style="
						display: block; 
						margin-left: auto; 
						margin-right: auto;
						border-width: 5px;
						border-style: solid;
						padding: 20px;
						max-width: 90vw;
					" />
					<img src="../../assets/artefacts/rmpp/discussions/eguidelines/ACM3-4.png" alt="applied acm guidelines" style="
						display: block; 
						margin-left: auto; 
						margin-right: auto;
						border-width: 5px;
						border-style: solid;
						padding: 20px;
						max-width: 90vw;
					" />
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						In the above tables, in the compliance columns: I've used the '?' symbol to indicate the potential 
						for the principle to broken in the future, and I've used the '!' to indicate that the principle was 
						broken by rogue members of the company, not representing the intention of the company. 
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						This brings me to my main criticism of the ACM principles - there's principles that lead to conflicting 
						conclusions. For example; principle 1.7 was broken by people protesting against the company, which is a 
						violation; but their action was justified as it promoted compliance with principles 1.2, 2.5 and 2.7. 
						These principles alone are not a replacement for an ethical framework for decision making. 
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						Even more shockingly, some of ethical principles might actually promote the development of the 
						defensive system - namely, principle 2.8. It all comes down to the matter of interpretation (Sylvia, 2015). 
						Unfortunately, this room in interpretation allows companies to defend controversial positions. 
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						I'd argue that the ACM principles are lacking in criticality and I hold the same opinion of 
						the BCS code of conduct too, which has the principle 'respect the organisation, or individual 
						you work for'. This principle justifies turning a blind eye to an employer's unethical actions. 
						To improve criticality, I would recommend forming a set of principles that are organised by priority, 
						or fitting an explicitly prioritised layer-model. In general, priorities shape decision-making, so 
						I theorise that 'ethical priorities' must exist that shape ethical (good) decision-making.

					<h3><u>My Intial Post / Peer A Response</u></h3>
					<p style="color:lavender">
						Hi Brad, 
					</p>
					<p style="color:lavender">
						Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I enjoyed reading your criticism of both the ACM and BCS codes, 
						and your demonstration of a need for interpretation in order to apply these codes. As others, 
						such as Seth (2023) have pointed out, although the ACM Code of Ethics is designed to be 
						comprehensive, it provides little to no guidance on defining goals of a system. It is also 
						unclear whether such codes have any observable effect on ethical decision making at all, even 
						if participants are explicitly asked to observe such codes (McNamara et al., 2018). 
					</p>
					<p style="color:lavender">
						The way you mapped out compliance (or non-compliance) in your tables is a great way to visualize 
						what is being talked about. I think it is generally difficult to create a general and universally 
						accepted set of ethical principles, as these can vary across cultures, believes, and countries. 
						I do, however, believe that a more context-aware guideline may be more effective in encouraging 
						ethical thinking. While the ACM and BCS codes have there flaws, we may be able to use them as 
						foundations for future codes. However, one problem remains - as long as such codes are up to 
						interpretation, they can be misused, and although they guide ethical decision making, they 
						do very little in resolving ethical dilemmas (Wheeler, 2003).

					<h3><u>My Intial Post / Peer A Response / My Response</u></h3>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						Thanks for the response Michael, I'm glad you liked the read. 
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						As researchers, I believe it's important to acknowledge methodological limitations for the comparison 
						of methods; and in some sense, a list of ethical guidelines are like a list of laws, 
						without the legal system governing them. I agree that it's difficult, if not 
						impossible, to create a universally accepted set of ethical principles, and 
						that's probably because there aren't many universally shared values. I 
						wouldn't want to discourage the use of ethical guidelines, because at 
						least in the case of ACM's and BCP's guidelines, the societies behind the 
						guidelines have reputable intent, and there are definitely arguments to made of the 
						benefits of guidelines too. Anybody who reflects on their own ethics will find 
						assurance in ethical guidelines, and they might indirectly affect people too. But, 
						I would like to see more meta-ethical reasoning / models behind each principle 
						because making the meta-ethics explicit allows for the comparison, evaluation and 
						prioritisation of meta-ethical models, which in turn, backs up the education of principles based upon them.
					</p>
					<h3><u>My Intial Post / Peer B Response</u></h3>
					<p style="color:lightseagreen">
						Thank you, Bradley, for your post and for sharing your thoughts on the criticism of the 
						ACM and BCS code concerning the Case study with the fictional scenario of the defence contractor.
					</p>
					<p style="color:lightseagreen">
						Organisations and companies providing services to the general public must constantly consider ethical 
						considerations, so it should be with the fictional defence contractor developing an autonomous vehicle. 
						However, McNamara et al. 2018 conclude that the ACM code of ethics has significantly less or no 
						influence on ethical decision-making. This pattern of breaking the ACM code is also seen in this 
						case, where you have identified a few breaches of code that the contractor has made. 
					</p>
					<p style="color:lightseagreen">
						I also agree that the ACM and BCS codes are just general guidelines and must not be legally followed 
						by any entity. Therefore, to enforce these guidelines, proper governing laws, such as the 
						Computer Misuse Act (UK Parliament, 1990), should be made and amended regularly to force 
						such service providers to make ethical decisions based on either the ACM or BCS code of conduct.
					</p>
					<p style="color:lightseagreen">
						Also, spreading awareness about the Code of Ethics and professionalism should be prioritised, promoting 
						a culture of good ethical practices. A study by Karim et al. (2017) also confirms that good 
						ethical practices contribute significantly to creating high-quality software products and 
						preserving the Code of Ethics.

					<h3><u>My Intial Post / Peer B Response / My Response</u></h3>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						Hi Prannoy,
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						I completely agree with you that protective ethical principles should made into proper governing laws.
						 Businesses are then obliged to comply with the principles, or pay for damages. 
						 Furthermore, the principles might be subject to more academic scrutiny, and more 
						 developmental effort to comply, as there is a financial incentive to do so too.
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						I also find the perspective you shared of Karim et al interesting, as taken to it's extreme, 
						we get a perspective where ethical codes might be viewed as product or service quality 
						checks. From that perspective, the objective of ethical codes isn't necessarily to create 
						general good, but to create good from a businesses perspective. However, I'd argue that this 
						perspective is detrimental to creating well-being in people generally, as the effect of 
						principles on profits becomes a factor in the creation of principles, meaning that certain 
						principles may not be created unless customers are paying for them to be enforced...
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						When it comes to the selection of general guidelines for ethics, I'm more 
						inclined to select principles that have an explicit underlying meta-ethical model 
						that I can critically agree with, such as the principles selected by Curry et al (2019) which are: 
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						1) Allocation of Resources to Kin (Family Values)
						<br>
						2) Coordination to Mutual Advantage (Group Loyalty)
						<br>
						3) Social Exchange (Reciprocity)
						<br>
						4) Contests between Hawks (Bravery) and Doves (Respect) [Just a note here, the terminology 'hawk' and 'dove' come from a biological game-theoretic model]
						<br>
						5) Division (Fairness)
						<br>
						6) Possession (Property Rights) 
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						These principles might seem as arbitrary as any other set of principles, except the moral valence of each 
						principle is accumulated from ethnographic records of 60 different societies. The underlying justification 
						can be critically compared with justification of different ethical codes.
					</p>
					<p style="color:blanchedalmond">
						Unfortunately, the original papers for the introduction of BPS and ACM's codes are not public, 
						and the principles are given moral valence by simply having intent to be professional beneath 
						them. But intent to be professional cannot be a replacement for criticality in an academic 
						setting. From a professional perspective though, adhering to ACM or BCS codes provides 
						coordination to mutual advantage, which is good for professional networking. Therefore if 
						you want to be professional, these are two really good sets of professional guidelines. More 
						academic credibility might be obtainable for these guidelines, by confirming Karim et al.'s 
						perspective that the adoption of these principles leads to improved product quality. Furthermore, 
						a moderator analysis could determine the effect size of individual principles on software 
						quality if enough literature exists connecting principle adoption to software quality. I 
						personally think this kind of meta-analysis is necessary to support a selection of 
						guidelines from an academic perspective.
